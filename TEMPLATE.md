### üì• Installation
1. Clone the repository locally:
   ```sh
   git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/biscuit-colorscheme/!PROJECT!.git
   ```
   In the case you can't use Git, or simply can't install it; go to the green button top right (the 'Code' button). After doing so, click on 'Download ZIP' and save it.   
2. Move the files over to  `~/.config/!PORT!`:
   ```sh
   mv ./!PORT!/*.!FILETYPE! ./.config/!PORT! # This is guessing that you're in your HOME directory.
   ```
   I also personally recommend making a folder called `themes/` inside your `~/.config/!PORT!` folder for organizing, but you decide if you do it or not.
3. Check that the files have been moved correctly:
   ```sh
   cd .config/!PORT! && ls -l # Again, this is guessing that you're still in your HOME directory.
   ```
   That should list all the files inside your `.~/.config/!PORT!` folder, if you see both `Biscuit-Light.!FILETYPE!` and `Biscuit-Dark.!FILETYPE!`; you've installed it correctly! Congrats!
4. IF ANY OTHER STEPS, PROCEED TO EITHER REMOVE, EDIT, OR ADD LINES.

### üì¶ Activating
Once you complete all the steps mentioned above, you can use your theme! Now, just add this line to the `!PORT!.!FILETYPE!` file inside `~/.config/!PORT!`:
1. Modify the config file for !PROJECT!
   ```sh
   !ACTIVATION PROCESS FOR PROJECT!
   ```
2. IF ANY OTHER STEPS, PROCEED TO EITHER REMOVE, EDIT, OR ADD LINES.
